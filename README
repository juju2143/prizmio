|    Prizm I/O 0.1    |
+---------------------+

Installation
------------
To install it, just specify the FXCGSDK environment variable
then run "make". If not specified, the installation directory
will be "../../".

Usage
-----
Add "-lprizmio" to LDFLAGS in your Makefile and include
"prizmio.h" in your code.

Prizm I/O 0.1 is compatible with Nspire I/O 2.0 so you can make
programs that works on both the Nspire and the Prizm (with some
#ifdef abuse).

To speed up the drawing, you should call the Bdisp_PutDisp_DD()
syscall yourself to draw the VRAM onscreen.

Documentation
-------------
An auto-generated documentation can be found in the "doc/html"
directory, just open "index.html" (if something is unclear,
please contact me and I will try to help you ;)
The code of the demo application can be found in "src/demo".
